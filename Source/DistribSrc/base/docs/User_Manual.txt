Installation
============

You may need to perform a one-time install of the freely redistributable CRT libraries from Microsoft, downloadable here_ or from the **RibTools** binaries package at ``Install\vcredist_x86.exe``.

.. _here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&displaylang=en 

Quick Start
===========

From the *RibTools* distribution directory, launch the file ``MakeTests.bat``, wait for it to complete and enjoy some fine renderings generated in the ``TestsOutput`` directory.

Three executables are currently distributed: *RibRenderToy*, *RibRender*, *RibRenderServer* and *RSLCompilerCmd*.

RibRenderToy
------------

This is a minimally interactive application that will render any RIB file present in the ``TestScenes`` directory.

Launch the application, **right click** in the window to open a menu from which to choose a file to render.

|MenuImg|  |RendImg|

.. |MenuImg| image:: images/develop-select-airplane-scene.png
    :width: 300px

.. |RendImg| image:: images/airplane.png
    :width: 300px

***Note*** that *RibRenderToy* always redirects the rendering to the application window, ignoring any target specified by the ``Display`` command in the RIB files.

RibRender
------------

This command will render a scene described by a `RIB file`_ into an image file or in a window.

From a command line, type ``RibRender -h`` to get the following help:

::

 ==== RibRender v0.9 -- (Feb 16 2010 - 02:54:03) ====
 
 RibRender <rib file> [options]
 
 Options:
     -help | --help | -h             -- Show this help
     -server <address>:<port>        -- Specify an IP and port number for a render server
     -forcedlongdim <size in pixels> -- Force the largest dimension's rendering size in pixels
     -colorgrids                     -- Show grids in false colors (for debugging)
 
 Examples:
     RibRender TestScenes/Airplane.rib
     RibRender TestScenes/Airplane.rib -server 192.168.1.107 -server 192.168.1.108:30000
     RibRender TestScenes/Airplane.rib -forcedlongdim 1024

***Note***: RIB scene description files usually specify the output format with an explicit ``Display`` command.
Therefore, a RIB file may decide whether the output will be in the form of an image file (usually TIFF) or in a window for display.
If no ``Display`` command is found, *RibRender* will automatically generate an RGBA TIFF image named ``frame0001.tif``.

RibRenderServer
----------------

This command acts for a render server for any *RibRender* command that will accesses this application thought the machine's IP and selected port.

From a command line, type ``RibRender -h`` to get the following help:

::

 ==== RibRenderServer v0.9 -- (Feb 16 2010 - 02:54:00) ====
 
 RibRenderServer [options]
 
 Options:
     -help | --help | -h  -- Show this help
     -port <port>         -- Wait for connection at port <port>
 
 Examples:
     RibRenderServer
     RibRenderServer -port 31111

***Note***: *RibRenderServer* gives an additional capability to distribute rendering but it is **not** necessary as *RibRender* is fully capable of rendering on its own.

RSLCompilerCmd
---------------

This command is included only for **internal testing purposes**. It compiles a .sl file into a RibRender .rrasm file type. Such operation is done internally by the renderer, and ***the user does not normally need to run this*** command explicitly.

General Usage
=============

In order to run the *RibRender*, *RibRenderServer* and *RSLCompilerCmd* commands from the command line shell from any directory in the system, the ``RIBTOOLS_DIR`` environment variable must be set.

In DOS/Windows this is accomplished by doing:

 SET RIBTOOLS_DIR=<Path>

Where ``<Path>`` is the pathname where the executables are, along with the ``ribtools.ini`` file (this file is used also to confirm that the directory is indeed RibTools' directory).

``SET`` however is not permament. To set an environment variable that persists after a reboot in Windows XP and above, use the `following instruction`_ from Microsoft.
